# Abstract

<code>Cis-regulatory elements can be classified by the shapes of their transcription initiation patterns,
which are indicative of distinct regulatory mechanisms. While massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) 
have enabled the functional study of sequence features within regulatory elements on an unprecedented 
scale, current MPRA approaches focus on quantifying transcript abundance, largely ignoring where 
transcription starts. This information however, could provide evidence that regulatory mechanisms in the 
context of the reporter assay resemble those active in the genome. Here we describe a transcription start 
site-capturing massively parallel reporter assay (TSS-MPRA) that simultaneously measures the location and 
frequency of transcription initiation. We characterize the degree to which plasmid-based MPRAs recapitulate 
endogenous initiation patterns (“TSS shapes”) and transcription levels and evaluate the effects of increasing 
insert length and reporter chromatinization on plasmid-derived transcription initiation. Employing a new 
bioinformatic approach to compare TSS shapes, we find that shorter, episomal constructs most faithfully replicate 
endogenous initiation patterns and transcription levels. Finally, we illustrate how TSS-MPRA can be used to decode 
cis-regulatory grammar by assessing the effects of core promoter and transcription factor motif mutations and 
single nucleotide polymorphisms on transcription initiation. Taken together, TSS-MPRA reveals important caveats
to consider when using MPRAs and enables high-resolution analysis of the sequence grammar underlying 
transcription initiation.</code>
